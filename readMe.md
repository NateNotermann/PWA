# PWA Test

Welcome to tmy first PWA.

## Overview

This repository for testing and exploring Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). I was curious about them so I thought I would try to make a simple pwa to start.

## Getting Started

1. Add Manifest.json file
2. write service-worker.js file
3. write <script> to try to register the service worker. Console log the result.
